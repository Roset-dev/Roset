      <ChangeItem title="Filesystem Semantics">
        Roset resolves anonymous data blobs into high-fidelity filesystem semantics. This includes a true folder hierarchy that is stored as metadata, not simulated with prefixes.
      </ChangeItem>
      <ChangeItem title="Instant Rename/Move">
        Renaming a folder with a million objects updates a single metadata record. Roset enables O(1) atomic moves and renames across your entire object storage namespace.
      </ChangeItem>
      <ChangeItem title="Sharing & ACLs">
        Create expiring, revocable share links with fine-grained permissions. ACLs inherit through the directory tree, independent of underlying cloud IAM policies.
      </ChangeItem>
      <ChangeItem title="Audit Logging & Trash">
        A complete, append-only operation log for every action. Deleted items move to a virtual Trash with configurable retention and instant restore capabilities.
      </ChangeItem>
      <ChangeItem title="Roset Agent (FUSE/CSI)">
        A unified binary that provides a high-performance FUSE client, a Kubernetes CSI driver for dynamic provisioning, and a technical CLI for field management.
