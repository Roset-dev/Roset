# What is Roset?

Roset promotes your object storage buckets (S3, R2, MinIO) to a **multi-tenant virtual filesystem** with real folder semantics, instant move/rename, fine-grained permissions, and complete audit trails.

## Why Roset?

| Raw Object Storage            | With Roset                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Key prefixes simulate folders | Real folder hierarchy in metadata  |
| Rename = copy + delete (slow) | Instant O(1) rename/move           |
| No permissions beyond IAM     | Fine-grained ACLs with inheritance |
| No audit trail                | Complete operation log             |
| No sharing                    | Token-based share links            |

## Data Never Flows Through Roset

Roset is a **control plane**: it manages namespace, policies, and coordination. Your files upload and download directly to/from your object storage via signed URLs.
