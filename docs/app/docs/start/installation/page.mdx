# Installation

Roset provides an official TypeScript SDK plus direct REST API access for any HTTP client. The SDK handles authentication, request formatting, and typed responses so you can focus on your application logic.

## TypeScript SDK (Recommended)

Install the SDK with npm, pnpm, or yarn:

```bash
npm install @roset/sdk
```

Requires Node.js 18 or later. Also works in edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun).

### Verify the Installation

```typescript
import { RosetClient } from '@roset/sdk';

// Initialize with your API key
const client = new RosetClient({ apiKey: 'rsk_...' });
console.log('Connected to Roset');
```

## Environment Setup

Store your API key as an environment variable instead of hardcoding it:

```bash
export ROSET_API_KEY=rsk_your_key_here
```

Then reference it in your code:

```typescript
import { RosetClient } from '@roset/sdk';

// Read the API key from the environment
const client = new RosetClient({
  apiKey: process.env.ROSET_API_KEY!,
});
```

<Callout type="caution">
Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Callout>

## Provider Keys

Roset orchestrates extraction providers on your behalf. All tiers use BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) for extraction providers. A small managed trial quota is included for evaluation.

You can optionally add your own provider keys in the console under **Settings > Provider Keys**:

- **Reducto** -- document extraction (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
- **OpenAI** -- vector embeddings
- **Gemini** -- image processing
- **Whisper** -- audio transcription

You can also manage provider keys through the API. See [PUT /v1/org/provider-keys](/docs/reference/api#put-v1orgprovider-keys) for details.

## Direct API Access

If you prefer not to use an SDK, all endpoints are accessible with any HTTP client. Roset is a standard REST API:

```bash
# List your files
curl https://api.roset.dev/v1/files \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey rsk_your_key"
```

See [Authentication](/docs/start/authentication) for details on supported auth methods.
